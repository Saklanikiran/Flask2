    "GET and POST are two common HTTP methods used in web development to send and receive data between a client (usually a web browser) and a server.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. GET Method:\n",
    "   - The GET method is used to request data from a specified resource.\n",
    "   - When a client sends a GET request, it appends the data to the URL in the form of a query string.\n",
    "   - GET requests are generally used for fetching data from the server without modifying it. For example, when you visit a webpage, your browser sends a GET request to the server to retrieve the HTML content, images, scripts, etc.\n",
    "   - GET requests can be bookmarked and cached, as they are considered idempotent, meaning they should not have any side effects on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. POST Method:\n",
    "   - The POST method is used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource.\n",
    "   - When a client sends a POST request, the data is sent in the body of the HTTP request, not in the URL like with GET requests.\n",
    "   - POST requests are often used when you need to send data that is not suitable to be appended to the URL, such as when submitting forms or uploading files.\n",
    "   - Unlike GET requests, POST requests can have side effects on the server, such as updating a database or creating a new resource.\n",
    "   - POST requests are not cached and cannot be bookmarked directly.\n",
